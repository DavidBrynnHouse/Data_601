## How to Navigate this Project

---

This project contains two folders each with a single file. The `Data` folder contains a .json file which was retrieved from [here](https://json.reddit.com/r/pics/top/?limit=100). This represents the top 100 posts of all time on the r/pics subreddit. The `Code` folder contains a jupyter notebook which I used to clean and analyse the data.

## My goals for this project

---

I was interested in looking at data taken from the web for my project. To do this I used the popular social media site www.reddit.com. This site allows users to upload pictures links and other media for other users to comment on and share. A unique feature of reddit is that users are able to upvote and downvote posts causing posts with more votes to move to the top where more people can see them. I wanted to see if there was any effect on the length of a posts title and how popular it became. 

## Obstacles during my project

---

* Using urls to access the reddit API I was unable to get more than the top 100 posts to a given subreddit. I think that had I been able to get all posts ever created for r/pics I would have a better idea of the effect that tile length has on a posts popularity. 

* When I started this project I first wanted to look at the most popular adjectives used in titles. However, I was unable to find a decent list of adjectives that I could use to match with words in the titles so I switched my goals around.

## Conclusions

---

Becuase I only have the top 100 posts from r/pics I hesitate to draw many conclusions without a loss of generality. However I can see that most posts tend to have fewer than 20 words.
